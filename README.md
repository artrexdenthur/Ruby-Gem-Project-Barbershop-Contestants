# BarbershopContestants

A ruby gem that scrapes [the Barbershop Harmony wiki](https://www.barbershopwiki.com/wiki/Barbershop_Wiki_Project) and provides info on contestants in the Barbershop Harmony Society International Competition. This gem is my Ruby CLI project for the [Learn.co](https://learn.co) web development track section one. Shout out to the other members of the "A Bug's Life" cohort!

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
